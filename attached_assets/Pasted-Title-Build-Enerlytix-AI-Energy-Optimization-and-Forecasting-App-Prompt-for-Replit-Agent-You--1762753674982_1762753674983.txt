Title: Build “Enerlytix” — AI Energy Optimization and Forecasting App
Prompt for Replit Agent:

You are building a full-stack web app called Enerlytix, themed around renewable energy optimization and forecasting for the ShriTeq hackathon.
 The app predicts, optimizes, and explains the best mix of solar, wind, and hydro energy sources for Indian regions using machine learning + linear programming + reinforcement learning.
Follow these detailed instructions step-by-step:

🧩 TECH STACK
Frontend: React + TailwindCSS (white, blue, orange theme)


Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.10+)


ML Libraries: scikit-learn, pulp (for LP), stable-baselines3 (for RL)


Data Handling: pandas, numpy


Visualization: Chart.js or Plotly for React


Database (optional for demo): SQLite with SQLAlchemy


AI Assistant: OpenAI API (GPT-4 or GPT-5) for answering energy-related questions



🎨 UI DESIGN
Theme:
 White background, blue highlights (#007BFF), orange accents (#FF7B00), clean modern look.
Layout:
A Login / Signup page first (simple form, store credentials in local DB).


After login, show the Main Dashboard, with a two-pane layout:


Left Side Panel (configuration menu)


Right Main Area (results, tables, graphs, and GPT assistant).



🧭 LEFT PANEL COMPONENTS
Use a collapsible sidebar on the left with the following options:
Region Dropdown:


Label: “Select Region”


Options: Major Indian Tier-1 Cities → Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Pune.


When a region is selected, load sample dataset (you can simulate it for now).


Forecasting Method:


Dropdown with options:


“Last Day Pattern”


“24 Hour Forecast”


“3 Month Prediction”


“1 Year Forecast”


“Exponential Smoothing”


The choice determines how far ahead the app forecasts renewable energy potential.


Configuration Choice (Energy Focus):


Radio buttons: “Solar Priority”, “Wind Priority”, “Hydro Priority”, “Balanced Mix”.


This slightly biases optimization weights.


Cost Weight Slider:


Label: “Cost Importance”


Range: 0.0 → 1.0 (in steps of 0.1)


Meaning: higher value = prioritize cost reduction; lower = prioritize emission reduction.


Run Optimization Button:


Label: “Run Optimization”


On click → run backend model that:


Performs forecasting (based on chosen method)


Runs Linear Programming (minimize cost + emissions)


Uses Reinforcement Learning (for adaptive dispatch decisions)


Then display outputs in the main area.



📈 MAIN DASHBOARD DISPLAY
When the user clicks “Run Optimization,” the right panel shows:
(1) Results Table
A comparison table with 3 columns:
Metric
Optimized Solution
Greedy Baseline
Cost (₹/MWh)
...
...
Emissions (kg CO₂)
...
...
Reliability (%)
...
...
Renewable Share (%)
...
...

(2) Energy Mix Graph
A stacked area chart (using Chart.js or Plotly):
X-axis: Time (hours/days)


Y-axis: Power (MWh)


Colored areas for Solar, Wind, Hydro showing contribution over time.


Include a “Demand Line” overlay showing how total power meets demand.


(3) Price Analysis Graph
Line chart comparing cost over time for baseline vs. optimized model.


(4) Emission Reduction Chart
Pie chart showing emissions saved (%) due to renewable optimization.



🧠 CUSTOM GPT INTEGRATION (ENERGY MENTOR)
In the right panel, below the charts, add a chat window labeled:
💬 “Ask the Enerlytix AI Mentor”
🧮 BACKEND LOGIC (FastAPI)
1. Forecasting:
For now, use dummy functions that simulate different forecast behaviors:

 def forecast(method, region):
    # returns fake but realistic generation data for solar/wind/hydro
    if method == "Last Day Pattern":
        ...
    elif method == "Exponential Smoothing":
        ...
    return solar_pred, wind_pred, hydro_pred, demand


2. Optimization:
 Use Linear Programming to minimize:
Total Cost + (emission_weight × Emissions)
Subject to:
Demand satisfaction = solar + wind + hydro


Each source ≤ capacity limits


Non-negative generation


Output:
 Optimal percentage of energy mix for each source.
3. Reinforcement Learning (optional extension):
 Create a mock RL agent using stable-baselines3 that learns to minimize cost + emissions based on historical forecast data. You can fake this behavior with random but logical data for hackathon speed.
4. Data Simulation:
 Use CSVs or JSON files as mock datasets for Tier-1 cities, containing:
Solar irradiance


Wind speed


Historical cost and emission per MWh


Example dataset columns:
datetime,solar_output,wind_output,hydro_output,demand,cost,emissions


🔗 FLOW SUMMARY
User logs in.


Selects region, forecast method, configuration, cost importance.


Clicks “Run Optimization.”


Backend runs forecasting + optimization → returns results.


Frontend shows:


Result table


3 graphs (mix, price, emission)


Custom GPT mentor for explanation.



🧠 HACKATHON-LEVEL FAKE DATA IDEA
If you don’t have real datasets, use:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

dates = pd.date_range("2025-01-01", periods=24, freq="H")
solar = np.maximum(0, np.sin(np.linspace(0, np.pi, 24))) * 50
wind = np.random.uniform(10, 40, 24)
hydro = np.random.uniform(20, 30, 24)
demand = 80 + np.random.uniform(-5, 5, 24)

Return this as mock city data.

🧑‍💻 PROJECT OUTPUT EXPECTATION
The final Replit app should include:
Login/Signup page


Sidebar with dropdowns/sliders


“Run Optimization” button


Table of results


Three main charts


GPT chat panel


White-blue-orange clean UI

Lets users configure renewable scenarios for Indian cities


Runs cost + emission optimization


Visualizes the energy mix dynamically


And uses a GPT mentor to explain results conversationally.
